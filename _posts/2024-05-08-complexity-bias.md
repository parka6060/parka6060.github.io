*Complexity bias* is our tendency to favour complex explanations and solutions over simple ones. Solutions do not have to be complex, but we romanticize complexity. Complexity bias is why there are endless debates over diet, exercise, and everyday decision-making. It's why the Internet is filled with course sellers, spiritual gurus, and Andrew Tates; they're trying to commodify our desires for the most advanced, cutting-edge information. And it's why I find myself wearing a set of laser goggles every night before I sleep. 

(If you're curious why it's because red light wavelengths (630-670nm) work through specific biological mechanisms to improve sleep quality. They don't suppress melatonin production like blue light does, and when delivered through the eyes, they affect the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) minimally, resulting in less disruption to natural sleep-wake rhythms. People think I'm insane for this.)

**Interestingly, complex systems are inherently more challenging to sustain over time.** Complexity is both hard to maintain and inefficient. Moreover, the mere *perception* of complexity creates aversion; I have lots of first-hand experience with this. When I first decided to start going to the gym, I found myself spending hours online researching the 'best' fitness routines for beginners. I was anxious and self-conscious about appearing inexperienced and worried about wasting time on inefficient exercises. Caught up in analysis paralysis (the little sibling to complexity bias), I ended up spending far more time researching than I did going to the gym. I only started making real progress only once I stopped trying to find the most optimal plan and actually went to the gym.

So here's what I learned. The best solution? Just pick the easiest one  you can stick to. Whether it's fitness, art, or any other goal. The pursuit of perfect complexity prevents you from taking basic action. Just start. Please just start.
